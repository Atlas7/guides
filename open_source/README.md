# Open Source Projects

We love open source as we are very aware of the power it has, not just from re-using code from someone's else library but it is a great way to tell the people how do we actually do things and that we can also collaborate a bit. We think that things to keep in mind if you someone is building or collaborating on a project are:

* Be passionate
* Be kind
* Be open to criticism
* Document your library in a way your grandma could understand
* Be respectful of someone's else feedback
* Don't reinvent the wheel
* Have fun

## Documenting your project

We think a big part of building or collaborating on open source projects is that you may have a great code but with a great power, comes great responsibility. What we mean by that is try hard and then harder to **document** your project on a way a rookie could easily understand on how to implement it and probably collaborate in the near future.

We have a [SAMPLE](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/icalia_guides/blob/master/open_source/SAMPLE.md) with the minimum sections you should have on an open source project, wheter you are the author or just collaborating. It may suffer changes due to the nature of the project but we have encounter this fits on almost everything.
