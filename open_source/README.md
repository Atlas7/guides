# Open Source Projects

We love open source as we are very aware of the power it has, not just from re-using code from someone's else library but it is a great way to tell the people how do we actually do things and that we can also collaborate a bit. This guide will help you in every step of the open source project development. And if you don't want to create a project from scratch and just contribute we also have your [back](#Collaborate-on-a-project)

## Create a new open source project

You don't need to be [DHH](https://twitter.com/dhh?lang=es) to start an open source project, the varience of open source means that anyone with a text editor, terminal and an internet connection can help build some really cool things with really cool people. Just make sure you have the following points in mind: 


- Make something people want. Coming up with an idea is a great start, but also make sure that other people are as excited about it as you are. Otherwise you'll end up building something that solves your own needs and that's not what open source is about. 
- Your project must have a motivation, you need to create something useful for the world. Take a step back and re-focus about what pain points your project is solving
- Your goal is not build a finished product, start out by building the simples prototype possible

## Publish your code!  

This is a really important part of the open source project development, a typical project will follow this steps:

## 1. Get your project on Github

We store all of our projects in Github. Github is home to more than 5 million open source projects for every skill set. It’s definitely the place where every developer can share their code with the world.

To get your project up and running in Github, you need to create a [public repository up on Github](https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/)

## 2. Document your project

We think a big part of building or collaborating on open source projects is that you may have a great code but with a great power, comes great responsibility. Good documentation is the key to the success of any project and by that you need to **document** your project on a way a rookie could easily understand on how to implement it and probably collaborate in the near future. Your project should include the documents stated in the following sections

### A readme file

`readme.md` is the file that provides a lay of the land for a project with details on how to use, build and sometimes contribute to a project. In this file people will learn about your project nature so it's important to ensure that when they arrive they'll understand what it is and how it solves their problems.  

- Describe what is the problem you’re solving and how it can benefit others. Remember to be clear & concise
- Use visual utilities to describe your project: Gifs & screenshots are a great way to do so
- Also it's a good idea to have a working demo example people can instantly use (you could use [heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) for this)
- Finally always keep this file (and any documentation) updated, this assure documentation stays relevant.

We have a [SAMPLE](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/icalia_guides/blob/master/open_source/SAMPLE.md) with the minimum sections you should have on an open source project. It may suffer changes due to the nature of the project but we have encounter this fits on almost everything.

### Use the wiki

Must of the times you'll need to go into more detail with your readme, and that's what the [wikis](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/) on Github is for, they help you break down documentation in your project in a useful way. Just add the links of the wiki in your readme file

### Build an identity

Building an identity for your project can help you a lot with branding. You should definilty start by making a concise Github repository description that helps people discover and share your project. When your project is displayed on your Github Profile the description gets displayed there (*also a concise message is really easy to copy/paste and share*)

Then you can take an advantage of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) they're free, easy to use and can be hosted directly from your Github Repository

### Get an audience

If people don't ever find your project, they can't possible benefit from it, So this last step consist on getting your project in front of an audience. If you have a content marketing team talk with them, they can help you in this process, or if you don't don't panic, post your project in the following pages: 

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)
- [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/reddits)
- [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) *You can use your organization account or your personal account*
- Reach out local and web communities. They can help you out spread the word

If your have a ruby project you can also post it here:
- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org)

If your have a mobile project you can also post it here:
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)

## Collaborate on a project

A great way to get involved in open source is to contribute to the existing projects you’re using. You can easily find a project in this places:

- [GitHub Explore:](https://github.com/explore) Browse different repositories solving all types of interesting problems
- [Github Trending:](https://github.com/trending) Trending projects
- [GitHub Showcases:](https://github.com/showcases) A way to discover related repositories.

Anyhow we think that things to keep in mind if you're someone that is collaborating on a project are:

* Be passionate
* Be kind
* Be open to criticism
* Document your library in a way your grandma could understand
* Be respectful of someone's else feedback
* Don't reinvent the wheel
* And always have fun
