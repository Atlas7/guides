# Usability Test Handbook

This Usability Test Handbook has the intention to evaluate and test a new or an already existing digital product with real users in a real scenario. The test consists of 3 stages: planning and preparation, testing, and solving. The objective of these stages is to have an organized perspective of what is being tested and how to gather relevant information from it, in order to solve any issues.

Keep in mind, however, that every project has different functionality and a different target user, so the purpose of this Handbook is to serve as base and build the test custom for each project.


## Stage 1 — Planning / Preparation

* Define Objective
&nbsp;
*What does the team want to accomplish with the Test?*

* Define Scenario
&nbsp;
*What is the user’s testing? / What is the user’s profile? / Where are we testing it?*

* Define Tasks
&nbsp;
*What is going to be tested? What do we want to find out? (User Stories are recommended)*


## Stage 2 — Testing

* Pre-interview
&nbsp;
*User’s background. It can be done with pen & paper, or using a digital form.*
&nbsp;
*Base questions:*
&nbsp;
1. *Any experience with “x” software?*
2. *Basic info: gender, age, profession, etc*
3. *What products / websites / apps are you familiar with, related to “x”?*
4. *What do you expect from “x” software?*

* Test
&nbsp;
*Recommended to use screen recording software (Screenflick).*

* Post-interview/Feedback
&nbsp;
*User’s thoughts. It can be done with pen & paper, or using a digital form.*
&nbsp;
*Base questions:*
&nbsp;
1. *What are your first impressions?*
2. *Would you use this on a regular basis?*
3. *What was the hardest task?*
4. *Any feedback?*


## Stage 3 — Solving

* Identify Key Issues
&nbsp;
*What tasks are not easy to accomplish?*

* Processing
&nbsp;
*Review notes, identify the usability issues and prioritize them*

* Findings
&nbsp;
*What are the Key Issues and how are we going to fix them?*

* Design Suggestions
&nbsp;
*What solutions are we offering in order to fix the Key Issues?*

* Re-test the recently fixed issues
&nbsp;
*Did we fix the issues?*
