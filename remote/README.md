### Guidelines

Here are a couple of guidelines that every member at Icalia who is remote must follow:

* Say hi to everyone on the mornings, #general channel is a good fit for this.
* Say goodbye once you are off the work, just to let know the team you won't be as available as expected.
* Be online at Slack at all times, or at least when you are available
* Try to answer as fast as possible for a message
* Look for pinned messages at slack in #general, they are important ones
* Let the team know whenever you are unavaible(eating time, power nap, to take a walk)
* Schedule your day with google calendar, that way it will be easir to know if you are busy for some reason
* It is ok to be offline for a couple of hours, just let the team know you'll be off
* Use slack channels only for the purpose of their creation, whether is to share knowledge or a bunch of gifs
* On remote calls be at least 10 minutes early, it is a good way to test the quality, sounds and microphone
