### Guidelines

Here are a couple of guidelines that every member at Icalia who is remote must follow:

* Say hi to everyone on the mornings, #general channel is a good fit for this.
* Be online at Slack at all times, or at least when you are available
* Don't take to long to respond messages, 2 hours may be a good time frame
* Let the team know whenever you are unavaible(eating time, power nap, to take a walk)
* Schedule your day with google calendar, that way it will be easir to know if you are busy for some reason
* It is ok to be offline for a couple of hours, just let the team know you'll be off
* Use slack channels only for the purpose of their creation, whether is to share knowledge or a bunch of gifs
