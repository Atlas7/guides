# Taikai
===

Taikai is the code convention used at [Icalia Labs](http://icalialabs.com) to create beautiful and maintanable code to get things done.

It includes practices for multiple languages, based on our own experience and experts advice. It also includes how to handle code review when working with teammates.

* [Rails]()
* [Ruby]()
* [Git]()
* [Sass && CSS]()
* [Javascript && Coffescript]()
* [Objective-C && Swift]()
* [NodeJs]()
* [Deployment]()

Primary guidelines:

* Don't reinvent the wheel, reuse code from gems or plugins
* Be consistenT
* Be kind with your teammate
* Don't violate any guideline, unless you can convince another teammate of doing so

Language used on Taiki:

* "Choose" means that there could be multiple options to choose from
* "Use" is a positive declaration
* "Never" there is no reason why you are breaking the statement
* "Abstain" don't do it unless you have a good reason
