# RSpec

This is a guide to write slightly good tests to a ruby/rails application.

## Installing RSpec

To install rspec you can just do it through the CLI:

```console
% gem install rspec
```

This way you will have access to the `rspec` command and start adding tests to your applications.

## Testing on Rails

When working on a Rails app, we like to add [unit tests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) and [behavior tests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development). 

**The specs to add depend on wheter the actual spec adds value to the test suite or not. We trust the developer criteria.**

You can click the links below to know how we do it. Wheter is Unit or Behavior testing.
