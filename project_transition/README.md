####About company culture

Here in IcaliaLabs, our culture is very important, and that means our clients are very important, as well as our work, process, the team, etc. We are always looking for long term relationships but sometimes, for different reasons this relationship ends and we need to transfer the project's ownership to the client, but always keeping in mind this rules:
- Mutual respect and trust: Our main goal is mutual happiness, we love what we do and the impact of it, we also love the client's happiness, so, we do not want unsatisfaction from both sides under any circumstance.
- Mutual Benefit: According to the first point, we think every project's experience is invaluable and because of this deserves respect, we want the project's success, that's why we have the willing to help clients with all the arrangements to transfer the ownership properly. _We believe the transition should not be painful_

####About communication

In order to maintain everything organized and concentrated, we encourage you to maintain as few open communication channels as possible, Basecamp for example worked well for us, it is a simple communication channel where every information, is concentrated, avoid chat applications to take decisions, that is because chat messages will be lost in time.

Here in mexico have a saying: _**Cuentas claras, amistades largas**_ (English: **"settled accounts keep old friends"**) this saying means we need to log every taken decision, every agreement documented and cleared and not just by word, the reason: It will help you to avoid misunderstandings and keep the relationship healthy.

Do not forget to add every meeting minute to the comunication channel.

####The process

The process we intend to explain should take no more than 1 week and it is created from previous experiences.

#####Finishing features

The team member or members who are in charge of business development and communication with the client should inform the decision with development and design teams with enough time to finish the last features or redefine the current or latest sprints before the closing.

#####Clear pending bugfixes

Critical bugs deserve more attention unless the client's decision and what they want to achieve.

#####Prepare a brief report of technical debt

Write a brief report of at least this five points:

- Project's code health.
- Main features pending to development.
- If the project's have TDD/BDD specs, all the specs should pass

#####Schedule a revision meeting

Critical bugs deserve more attention unless the client's decision and what they want to achieve.
