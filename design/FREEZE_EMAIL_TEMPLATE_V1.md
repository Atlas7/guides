Hello <CLIENT_NAME>,

First of all we'd like to say thanks for believeing on us and let us share this past two weeks with you. You should congratulate yourself, it's been quite a ride and you made a lot of important decisions in just a couple of days.

The next big step is to review the Statement of Work, which you can find as an attachment to this email.

This document describe the scope for your MVP(Minumum Viable Product) from a design and functionality perspective, and which will allow us start making your idea come true.

There is no rush on the signature, take a breath, talk to your team, give it for a last spin and whenever you are ready we will be happy to start.

We'll be at your service in case you need anything else or if you have questions or comments regarding this.

Again, thanks for the time and effort you put on this 2 weeks.

Best,
