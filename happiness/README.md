# Happiness

We strongly believe the happier a developer is, the more beautiful code he/she will create. Consider this text as suggestions on how to improve your productivity and increase your happiness while you code.

### Avoid multitasking, machines can handle it.

Yeah, it's very simple, we bet you can do more than one thing at a time, but please try to avoid this practice, the reason? well... if you do one thing at a time you will likely achieve your daily goals faster and reduce the error possibilities.

Chill out and try it, your brain will thank you for not putting it into much stress trying to process two or more things at a time, _remember, multitasking is only for computers_.

### Pomodoro technique

Do more and have fun with time management is the premise of this technique.

- The core of this technique is: _"stay focused on one thing at a time"_.

- One task should take 25 minutes, if you think your task takes more, consider splitting it into smaller tasks.

- After a pomdoro (25 min) you can take a break (5 minutes), then, start another pomodoro.

- For every 4 pomodoros you can take a break of 20 minutes.

### Control your inbox

Sometimes we have a communication channel with our clients and coworkers, but let's face it, if we have to check and reply to emails everytime we receive them we end our day with a bad feeling of an unproductive day.

So, if you are completely involved in development, our advise is:

_Schedule 20 minutes during the day to check email and comunication channels, such as slack, email, etc._

_If you have a project management role (ScrumMaster, Team Leader, Lead Dev, etc.) consider schedule a few events (every 2 hours for example) to comunicate with your team or clients._

### Take the most out of your text editor

Well, it's simple, try to learn shortcuts, write faster, avoid using the mouse (just if it is necessary), just try it, we are pretty sure you'll find this kind of funny and productive.

### Read more than just technical stuff.

Here at IcaliaLabs, we are a multicultural group with one thing in common:  _TECHNOLOGY_, it's our passion, what we breath and eat every day, but we also have a lot of things to talk about. Some people of the team have hobbies such as photography, reading (novels, science, etc.), watch movies, and many more. Sometimes taking some time off to do any activity we love helps improve productivity as well.

### Eat well & exercise

We know pizza and burguers are the hacker favorites but consider something a bit healthier, fruit is a good example. Try to include greens on every meal you have, it will definitely make you feel better, and let's be honest dropping a bit of weight has never make anyone sad.

Walk, run, jump, climb, play soccer, go up and downstairs, stay active.

### Learn something new

Learn something new, new frameworks, programming languages, music, a new language, whatever you want, it's like you are upgrading your mind. Remember not only your body is the only one who needs to be on sharp!

### Share!

Yeah, share the knowledge, talk at meetups, give conferences, transfer knowledge to a new icalier or someone you don't know!

### Relax

If you ever feel like you need to concentrate, or have a need to rest and refresh, there is a nice place called [selfcare.tech](http://selfcare.tech/) where you can find many tools which will help you take better care of yourself.
