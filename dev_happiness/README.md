# Dev happiness

In the first chapter of Icalia TechTalks we were talking about some dev tips & tricks to be more effective and increase our productivity, there are a few points, consider this text as suggestions and not rules, we really hope you can find this helpful.

### Avoid multitasking, let this for machines.

Yeah, it's very simple, we bet you can do more than one thing at a time, but please avoid this practice, the reason? well... if you do one thing at a time you can achieve your goals faster and reduces the error possibilities, also you'll eliminate distractions and make your work in the best possible way.
Chill out and try it, your brain will thank you for not put him to process two or more things at a time, _remember, multitasking is only for computers_.

### Pomodoro technique

Do more and have fun with time management is the premise of this technique.

- The core of this technique is: _"stay focused on one thing at a time"_.

- One task should take 25 minutes, if you think your task takes more, consider split into smaller task

- After a pomdoro (25 min) you can take a break (5 minutes), then, start another pomodoro.

- For every 4 pomodoros you can take a break of 20 minutes.

### Control your inbox

Sometimes we have a communication channel with our clients and coworkers, but let's face it, if we have to check and respond emails everytime we receive it we end our day with a bad feeling of an unproductive day.

So, if you are completely involved in development, our advise is:

_Schedule 20 minutes during the day to check email and comunication channels, such as slack, email, etc._

_If you have a project management like role (ScrumMaster, Team Leader, Lead Dev, etc.) consider schedule a few events (every 2 hours for example) to comunicate with your team or clients._

### Typewriting speed

Well, it's simple, try to learn shortcuts, write faster, avoid using the mouse (just if it is necessary), just try it, I'm pretty sure you'll find this kind of funny and productive.

### Read more than just technical stuff.

Here at IcaliaLabs, we are a multicultural group with one thing in common:  _TECHNOLOGY_, it's our passion, what we breath and eat every day, but we also have a lot of things to talk about, Some people of the team have hobbies such as photography, reading (novels, science, etc.), movies, and many more, we'd really like to hear and learn more about you.

### Learn something new

Learn something new, new frameworks, programming languages, music, a new language, whatever you want, it's like you are upgrading you mind.

### Share!

Yeah, share the knowledge, we'll appreciate it!

+1 if you are involved in development communities, meetups, hackatons, etc.
