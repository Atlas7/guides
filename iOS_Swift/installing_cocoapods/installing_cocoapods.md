## What's CocoaPods?

**CocoaPods** is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. In other words, these are cool libraries that make your life easier when developing an app.

## How to install

CocoaPods is built with Ruby, which already comes installed in your Mac, so all you have to do is go to your terminal and run the following command: 

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```
