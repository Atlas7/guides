## What's CocoaPods?

**CocoaPods** is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. In other words, these are cool libraries that make your life easier when developing an app.

## Why use CocoaPods?
CocoaPods makes managing dependencies in your code easier. If you wand to add some Open Source Code to your project, CocoaPods makes it easier by helping you with managing versions of the code you want to import. 

Also, with the documentation provided by the author it's easier to know what is going on with the code and the best way to use it.
