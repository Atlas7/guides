#Project Administration

Nowadays many developers have to take on the responsibilities of not only development but also project administration.

Some of us here at Icalia have suffered the pain of going down that road many times, so we will try to give you some tips on how to do this as easily and painlessly as possible.

Again this is based on our own experience, so any comments or tips are more than welcome.
